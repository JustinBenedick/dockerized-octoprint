Debian

These commands require a POSIX compatible shell like bash. For other shells like fish, temporarily run bash -i.

Cockpit is included in Debian since version 10 (Buster).

    To get the latest version, we recommend to enable the backports repository (as root):

    . /etc/os-release
    echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian ${VERSION_CODENAME}-backports main" > \
        /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list
    apt update

    Install or update the package:

    apt install -t ${VERSION_CODENAME}-backports cockpit

When updating Cockpit-related packages and any dependencies, make sure to use -t ...-backports as above, so backports are included.


sudo chown -R pi octoprint/
sudo chmod -R 777 octoprint/
sudo chgrp -R pi octoprint/
